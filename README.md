## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styles
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) + [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Fetching data

### What I learned

I didn't want to use `useEffect` and `fetch` and I decided to use `react-query` and `axios` instead, even though the task was pretty simple and standard tools would be enough. So here I remembered how to attach these tools to project and use them effectively.

### Continued development

Read all TKDodo's articles.
